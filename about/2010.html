      <h1>About Colin (2010)</h1>

<p class="intro">
  The bulk of this version of my “About Me” page was written in October of 2010 and contains 
  tiny updates made from then through mid-2011. Broken links a distinct possibility.
</p>

<p>If you are looking for details about me, I suppose you’ve come to the right place.</p>

<p><strong>From the beginning…</strong> I was born outside of Philadelphia but moved to New Jersey at a young age.
I grew up in Central New Jersey. People that aren’t from our lovely state may have a negative perception
of the place or the people here, but it’s a pretty awesome place. I had a childhood fairly typical of an
only child.</p>

<p>In fact, a lot of the details of my growing up and travels were previously documented on
<a href="http://www.thosekids.org/travelogue/wiki.php?n=Travelers.Colin">a profile I created</a> for a trip through
Europe I was taking with friends. You can also <a href="http://www.thosekids.org/travelogue/wiki.php">read a lot about that trip at that site</a>
or check out <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/mccolin/collections/72157600321586434/">my many pictures from the excursion</a>.</p>

<p><strong>A few months after that trip in 2007…</strong> I founded,
<a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/mccolin/sets/72157601842524494/">produced, planned, and ran</a> the very first
WOSoMP. What is <strong>WOSoMP</strong>, you ask? It’s an acronym for the Weekend Olympic Showdown of Massive
Proportions and the event was exactly as it sounds. We brought along some kegs, some complicated rules,
and more than 30 friends to what was a competition in nine sporting events invented or humorously altered
from their norms by your’s truly. The weekend remains one of the favorite things I’ve ever done and I keep
promising people a follow-up event. My targets are set for another weekend in 2011. I’ll keep you posted.</p>

<p><strong>A couple months later, I jumped ship to San Francisco…</strong> to become the fourth employee of a startup
company. Making this move in very early 2008 was fairly unexpected for me. After visiting San Francisco
for the first time the previous June, I thought I liked it, but never saw myself living there. I was
wrong! My time in San Francisco was incredible, if somewhat brief. My moving was the catalyst that
finally got me together with my <del>soon-to-be</del> wife (you can read all about how cute we are
<a href="http://www.lizandcolin.us/">on our website</a>). I met dozens of great people and a big chunk of hopefully
lifelong friends. I reconnected with an old schoolmate and formed an even better friendship than we had
back on the east coast. I enjoyed the experience of living in one of the most exciting and cultural
cities in the word. I recommend San Francisco to anyone. Go visit. Go live there. Just go.</p>

<p><strong>And after nearly three years…</strong> I came back east. My fiancé, Liz, and I
<a href="http://lizandcolin.tumblr.com/">packed up a moving truck and hit the open road</a> towards greater
Philadelphia. It was time to come home. Years away from our closest friends and family had been hard,
and we had business to attend to, like <a href="http://lizandcolin.us">getting married</a> and starting the next
phase of our awesome lives together.</p>

<p><strong>That’s a few decent chunks of my story.</strong> If you were looking for more of a bullet-point type experience, here’s some more tidbits for you:</p>

<ul>
<li>I am taller than your average dude, but nothing majorly exciting.</li>
<li>I broke my left leg jumping out of a swing (and sticking the landing) about three weeks before going to college.</li>
<li>When I switched school districts as a kid, I didn’t get into the gifted and talented program like in my old town on the first try. I’m convinced this is because I said the word “migrate” had something to do with rocks instead of moving, relocation, or birds. It irks me to this day.</li>
<li>I had long hair and a ponytail (down to mid back) from fifth through tenth grade. Though it was healthy and by no means a “rat tail,” this mullet-in-disguise was probably the worst style decision of my life.</li>
<li>I am not confident that I know how to use a rotary phone. Or operate storm windows.</li>
<li>My favorite foods are all starches. Or covered in cheese. Mmmm…</li>
<li>My favorite color was green for my entire childhood and young adult life. Then I switched to orange for no real, discernible reason sometime in college and haven’t  looked back.</li>
<li>I use a special, weird voice when I talk to dogs. Or when a dog walks by on the street. Or when I see a dog. I think they like it.</li>
<li>I still think that drawing things out on paper or a dry-erase board first is the best way to visualize it. Web designs. Database architectures. Furniture layouts. Chinese food orders. Anything. It helps me think.</li>
<li>The books I’ve been reading lately are 90% pictures, but my all-time favorite books are probably, in no particular order, To Kill A Mockingbird, The Stranger, In Cold Blood, One Flew Over the Cuckoo’s Nest, and The Lottery.</li>
<li>I am terrified of (and fascinated by) zombies, sharks, and snakes.</li>
<li>I play bass guitar. Sometimes in a band called Monica’s Ghost.</li>
<li>My mom calls me “bunyip” as a pet name. It’s not clear to me whether or not she knew that a Bunyip was a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bunyip">mythological Australian monster</a> at the time she started calling me that.</li>
</ul>
