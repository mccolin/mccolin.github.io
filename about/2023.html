      <h1>About Colin</h1>

<p>
  Who, me!? I'm a married, father of two living in 
  <a href="https://www.visitphilly.com/">Philadelphia, PA</a>. I work full-time
  in front of a computer screen, but enjoy spending time with my family, taking
  in sporting events, and long chats with friends when
  <a href="http://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=away%20from%20keyboard">AFK</a>.
  In recent years, I've lost a bit of myself to parenting two beautiful (and
  crazy) kids, but bits of the old me shine through every so often.
</p>

<p>
  I'm an east-coaster at heart, having been born outside of Philadelphia, growing
  up in New Jersey, and attending <a href="https://www.udel.edu/">college in
  Delaware</a>. I went west to San Francisco at the start of my career, but found
  my way back to the
  <a href="http://hiddencityphila.org/2013/11/behind-philadelphia-maneto-dissecting-the-city-seal/">City of Brotherly Love</a>
  in due time.
</p>

<p>
  Along the way, I've kicked off a semi-regular olympiad of wacky sports, run my
  own software consultancy, helped found a tech startup, and balanced my career
  between remote and in-person work in many different contexts.
</p>

<p>
  Personally, I married up in terms of brains and beauty, and created two amazing,
  small humans who keep me on my toes most days. If you need me, generally you can
  find me kicking around my neighborhood striving to become a regular at my
  favorite sandwich and coffee shops.
</p>


<h2>Other Things to Know</h2>
<ul>
  <li>I grew up thinking I'd love living in rural areas, but have come to realize <a href="http://www.visitphilly.com/">cities</a> <a href="http://www.sftravel.com/">are</a> <a href="https://www.thrillist.com/entertainment/nation/why-cities-are-better-than-rural-america">the best</a></li>
  <li>I broke my left leg just before college. There, I moved so slowly that a group of freshmen in a Christian club tried to ditch me during a scavenger hunt. Served me right, because I was a heathen only on the hunt for the free ice cream at the end.</li>
  <li>The deep ocean &mdash; and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shark">the</a> <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marine_snow">things</a> <a href="http://animalia-life.club/fishes/northern-stargazer.html">in</a> <a href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/sciencetech/article-1155283/What-catch-The-amazing-deep-sea-fish-transparent-head.html">it</a> &mdash; unnerve me, but I love the shore.</li>
  <li>I play bass guitar. Sometimes in a band called <a href="https://fb.me/MonicasGhost">Monica’s Ghost</a>.</li>
  <li>My favorite color is orange.</li>
  <li>I wore my hair in a ponytail from fifth through tenth grade. It a very questionable style choice.</li>
  <li>I love dogs, but can't have one because my wife is allergic. This is fine with me.</li>
  <li>At a party after high school, <a href="http://colinmccloskey.com/music/ClintAmbs_TheMcCloskeys.mp3">a good friend of mine improvised a song about my family</a>.</li>
</ul>
